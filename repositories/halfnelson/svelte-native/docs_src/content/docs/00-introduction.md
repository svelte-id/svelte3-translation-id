#### What is NativeScript?

[NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) is an open-source framework to develop apps on the Apple iOS and Android platforms. It is open source and can be found on [github](https://github.com/nativescript/nativescript).

#### What is Svelte?

[Svelte](https://svelte.technology) is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.

#### What is Svelte Native

Svelte Native is a tool for building mobile applications. It combines NativeScript's access to the native platform views and Svelte's fast and efficient view updates to allow you to build native mobile experiences using tools such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.
